Various ideas currently intended to be implemented, or under consideration for implementation, in the future.

## Hardened CPU architecture

Currently, the CPU is structured for essentially single program, single
permission execution. There is no invalid state handling and any error
immediately stops execution. Normal CPUs do not function this way, and the
current structure makes it essentially impossible to trust or limit any
sub-programs that need to be run after the CPU has booted.

This proposal addresses the idea of a more hardened CPU architecture, designed
for resilience after errors during execution and support for an idea similar to
having multiple privilege levels. Haywire programs should not be able to stop
execution, and ideally the special case of a null opcode ending execution would
be removed.

This proposal focuses on two central ideas:
- A _global descriptor table_ or equivalent, providing rules as to which
  sections of memory are accessible (reading, writing, jumping) from which
  positions, or perhaps a simpler system that accomplishes a similar thing
- An _interrupt descriptor table_ or equivalent, providing a set of addresses to
  jump to when it is necessary to handle certain interrupts. Following this
  table likely will ignore the global descriptor table due to the limited scope
  of this table, as well as the fact that interrupt handling can be designed
  with this knowledge.

A simple way to achieve the global descriptor table (GDT) likely entails having
a list of boundaries in memory, across which reads, writes, or jumps cannot
occur. This would encourage locality and keep the system simple, but might not
work out with the concept of virtual addresses.

This table would only permit adding region descriptor entries around regions
that the current region is not subject to. Essentially, it would be possible to
allocate any regions anywhere before there are any, but adding more would only
be able to make privilege more granular, and it's not possible to remove a
region descriptor entry from within the region, of course. This means that any
region-based activities should not be proxied through function calls because
they will apply from the called region and can potentially result in privilege
escalation.

Programs could be initialized by writing the program to memory and then adding a
barrier to it. How would barrier removal work, though? If you can't remove a
barrier you're affected by, programs could just remove barriers for other
programs. I suppose specifying a removal point on creation might be a good
option.

Entering a block would only be possible from the left, by jumping to the
instruction right before it starts and requiring the CPU to increase the
instruction pointer past the boundary. Exiting from the block, then, would only
be possible from the right, whether the limited block naturally reaches the exit
or if there's a jump to right before the right side of the block.

Interrupts would be another way to exit from blocks. Interrupts would be
implemented with an interrupt descriptor table (IDT), storing, at minimum, an
array (where the index is the interrupt id) of table entries, with each entry
containing the destination address to jump to on interrupt, as well as the
address to write the previous address that was being executed from.

Interrupts would be trusted to be jumped from anywhere because they have access
to the point they were jumped to from, so they can be designed around this
possibility.

One issue is that this system doesn't support the concept of *privilege levels*â€”
it only supports the idea of memory barriers. This means it might be impossible
to jump back to a given section in memory. A simple system could exist on top of
this, but again it would add more complexity.

## Minimum addressable size of one bit

Makes the minimum addressable size of the CPU equal to one (1) bit.

### Pros
- Makes multiplication easier
- Allows arbitrary bit shifting without an extra operation
- More variation when creating jump tables
- Doesn't increase any existing complexity when writing machine code

### Cons
- Significant performance decrease
- For emulator: not compatible with existing CPU architectures
- For physical circuit: requires many more wires

## Less detailed items

- Center the CLI around `cat main.asm | overscore assemble | overscore emulate` instead of `overscore assemble <file> | overscore emulate`
  - Potentially, an `overscore unity` command would manage the unity build for you, which includes remapping error names to the correct file.
  - Or, a multi-file format that contains file names and other metadata. Either custom or a `.zip`.
- Support relative addressing for PIE via compiler directives (e.g. `@rjump Foo` instead of `mov [0] Foo`)
  - Requires not modifying the instruction pointer after a jump as it is done now
- Allow specifying the address of certain assembly, emitting a compile error if any of it overlaps.
  - E.g. "sections X and Y overlap on memory ranges A to B"
- Fix error messages including preceding whitespace, e.g. for `mov [[[Stack]]] Main.AfterCall`.
- Disassembler and debugger.
- Compress instruction sizes
- JIT/AOT compilation for the CPU
- CPU benchmarks (preliminary testing indicates about ~390 million instructions per second on my computer)
